#A sample mongodb/nodejs server project

This is a project I am working on in my spare time to bring together MongoDB, Node.js, and Backbone.js technologies into a functioning website. It is currently in the beginning stages of development.

Developed on an AWS ec2 instance. Reference: *Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone*, by Mike Wilson.
